      <h3>Phase 1</h3>

      <p>
        This is my phase 1 for the group project. The approach I made was to
        take straight lines and curly lines then combine the two together at the
        edge with a triangle. This was sort of a random experiment join together
        to have the line meet in order to get the shape that I need, however,
        the orignal idea was to make sure we all agreed upon the triagle shape
        so we make duplicates of it. Basically we all traced one side of a
        positive and the other is negative to make sure all the pieces align
        toward the end. The two images above are my cuts.

      <h3>Phase 2</h3>
      <p>
        During phase 2, I choose the hook attach method and went with the card
        suite. The first time around there wasn't much flexibility and all the
        suit sort of look the same with just the hook added on toward the end.
        After some feedback I went back and added more variation to the shape
        and expand further beyond playing it safe with the card suites. First
        image is the first stage. Second image is after getting the feedback and
        I went back to fix. This was a hook method on paper cutout.

      <h3>Phase 3</h3>
      <p>
        In phase 3 (I feel like this is an MCU rip-off) anyway, we designed our
        own mythical creature after having some feedback with our project. We
        made a set of cards to go with them like Yugioh. Once you drew a card
        you would allow to create your very own unique hideous creature by mix
        and matching. We made mermaid, dragon, minotaur, anubis, and unicorn.
        Some of the pieces came out very nice like the minotaur had a perfect
        notch cutout. Also the dragon as well. The other one's like mermaid and
        anubis was on life support. The unicorn was a fine medium of in between
        of notches cutout. My piece was the anubis set which had problems with
        the fasterners. The measurements came out incorect and then the lasers
        slice it twice which wasn't very nice after adding insult in incorrect
        measurements. I helped with making sure everyone pieces were all cutout
        and we had a total of all pieces. I helped with the video and tech
        support during the crunch time right before presentation. Anthony bought
        the acrylic and helped everyone with illustrator. Bernice created the
        mermaid design and she book the slot for our laser cut and helped
        removed the tape in the acrylic. Ianne made the dragon set and she also
        helped with booking the laser room. Austin created the schema and worked
        on the card of the creatures. Jabai out.
