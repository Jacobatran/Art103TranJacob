            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;"> Team Name Laser Raptor<br>
                Our group present in class based on the given three options. <br> 
                They were Children Singing and Laughing, Courage!!! and Be Less Critical. <br>
                We chose <strong>Courage</strong> as a art repsonse pieces. <br>
                As part of this challenge I did mine based on what I was afraid of, and that was judgement of others or criticism.
                <br> I decided to paint my nails and walk around in public. I had all kind of weird stares but I don't know whether <br>
                that is me being super cautious of everything or people were actually staring. I guess you can say about 50/50 of weird stares and other is based on my fear of judgements.
