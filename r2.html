          Q1. What are the similarities and differences regarding the work of
          Walter De Maria and Banksy?
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          The similarities of Walter De Maria and Banksy is that both artist
          make public natural environment to display their artwork to the
          public. De Maria interested in internal reactions from people who
          experience his art from the feeling of transcendence or introspection.
          De Maria also Walter De Maria uses more natural setting such as some
          place outdoors or in the wilderness. Banksy is more ironic and plays
          on social commentary. Banksy work on the streets in a public
          environment but in a more secret manner.

        <p>
          I do like the Golden Gate bridge in SF because of its particular color
          and engineering feat that it overcome during that era. Its not just an
          object but serve as a functional object to everyday lives and now its
          an international landmark.
