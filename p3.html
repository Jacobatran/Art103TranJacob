        I choose to model the object by using the Power of 2's number sequence.
        All my dimension values share the same constraints.

      <h3>CAD/CAM, Modeling objects and Toolpath Simulations</h3>
      <p>
        I chose W as a way to present the world wide web for the alphabetical
        letters. I also chose W because it's not based on my name initial
        because that is so boring and everyone else is doing it. Also it's a
        contribute to the Warriors, Dubs Nation. For the symbol, I choose a
        flash sign because its simple and clean. everyone get the reference of
        thunderbolt or flash sign symbol world wide without much explaination.
        But to be honest I think my phone was dying and I was thinking of the
        thunderbolt charger.

      <p>
        For Phase 4 in MCU SJSU I chose Spartan Recreational Center. This is a
        place I go to when I want to release some stress from class work and
        want to get away from the books. This is a place where I feel like a
        child again and it's like a big play ground with other children running
        around. I visit this place to find peace and calm my anxiety and stress
        levels dealing with tons of assignemnts and feeling overwhelm. At the
        top on the second floor is a study lounge that I utilize to do my work
        after a good work out.

      <h3>
        Sign Installation and Presentation day
      </h3>
      <p>
        The class field trip for Phase 8, we visited my playground, the Rec
        Center and went inside but was stuck at the front because of the
        SeCurRity gate. Meanwhile everyone stood around looking all confused due
        to the high tech guarded doors, I present my work nervously because I do
        not like being the center of attention. I placed my AR stamp on a
        notebook that I used to doodle and take my personal notes with. The Coat
        of Arm was displayed on front of this notebook and as I flip the cover,
        in the back of it was the AR marker where you see my fusion model. It
        was beautiful.
